## **Project Overview**

This is the final project for the **DSTRU (Discrete Structures) class, Section S15**. Our project involves implementing a **strategic turn-based game** using the C programming language. The game operates on a **4x4 grid** where players take turns selecting positions, aiming to fulfill specific conditions to win.

---

## **Game Description**

- The game features three entities: **Uno, Dos, and Tres**.
- The players **Uno and Tres** take turns selecting positions on the grid.
- The goal is to **form predefined patterns** while following strict movement rules.
- **Dos wins** by default if the grid is fully occupied without a winner.
- The game ends when a player meets a winning condition or when no more moves are possible.

## **Installation and Setup**

### **Prerequisites**

- GCC Compiler (for compiling C code)
- A terminal or command prompt
- Git (optional, for version control)

### **Cloning the Repository**

```sh
git --
```

### **Compiling the Game**

```sh
gcc -Wall -std=c99 dstru-tac-toe-main.c dstru-tac-toe.c -o game
```

### **Running the Game**

```sh
./game
```

## **How to Play**

1. The game begins with an **empty 4x4 grid**.
2. Players take turns based on **turn-based mechanics**.
3. The game enforces rules for **valid moves** and **win conditions**.
4. The game ends when **one player wins** or **the grid is fully occupied**.
5. The program announces the winner or declares a draw.
6. *To be edited if ever*
